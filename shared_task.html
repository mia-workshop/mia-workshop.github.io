        Shared Task on Cross-lingual Open-Retrieval QA
      </h1>
    </div>
    <hr />
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Task Format</h2>
      <p>
        Cross-lingual Open Question Answering is a challenging multilingual NLP
        task, where given questions are written in a user’s preferred language,
        a system needs to find evidence in large-scale document collections
        written in many different languages, and return an answer in the user’s
        preferred language, as indicated by their question. For instance, a
        system needs to answer in Arabic to answer an Arabic question, but it
        can use evidence passages written in <em>any language</em> included in a
        large-document corpus.
      </p>

      <p>
        The evaluation is based on the macro-averaged scores across different
        target languages.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Target Languages</h2>
      <p>
        Our shared task will evaluate systems in <strong>14</strong> languages,
        <strong>7</strong> of which will <strong>not</strong> be covered in our
        training data. The training and evaluation data is originally from
        Natural Questions, XOR-TyDi QA, and MKQA (See details below in the
        Dataset section).
      </p>

      The full list of the languages:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Languages with training data:</strong> Arabic, Bengali,
          English Finnish, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Telugu
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Languages without training data:</strong> Spanish, Khmer,
          Malay, Swedish, Turkish, Chinese (simplified)
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Evaluations</h2>
      <p>
        Participants will run their systems on the evaluation files (without
        answer data) and then submit their predictions to our competition site
        hosted at <a href="https://eval.ai/" target="_blank">eval.ai</a>.
        Systems will first be evaluated using automatic metrics:
        <strong>Exact match</strong> and <strong>token-level F1</strong> (Lee et
        al., 2019; Asai et al., 2021; Longpre et al., 2021). For non-spacing
        languages (i.e., Japanese, Khmer and Chinese) we use token-level
        tokenizers, Mecab, khmernltk and jieba to tokenize both predictions and
        ground-truth answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the difference of the datasets' nature, we will calculate
        macro-average scores on XOR-TyDi and MKQA datasets, and then take the
        average of the XOR-TyDi QA average {F1, EM} and MKQA average {F1, EM}.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although EM is often used as a primarily evaluate metric for English
        open-retrieval QA, the risk of surface-level mismatching (Min et al.,
        2021) can be more pervasive in cross-lingual open-retrieval QA.
        Therefore, we will use F1 as our primary metric and rank systems using
        their macro averaged F1 scores.
      </p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Prizes</h2>
      <ul>
        <p>
          We have 3 award categories, each with Google Cloud credit prizes!
        </p>
        <li>
          <strong>The Best {unconstrained, constrained} system:</strong> These
          prizes will be given to the {constrained, unconstrained} systems (see
          the details in the Dataset Section) obtaining the highest
          macro-average F1 scores.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Creativity award:</strong> We plan to give additional award(s) to
          systems that employ a creative approach to the problem, or undertake
          interesting experiments to better understand the problem. This award
          is designed to encourage interesting contributions even from teams
          without access to the largest models or computational resources.
          Examples include attempts to improve generalization ability/language
          equality, reducing model sizes, or understanding the weaknesses in
          existing systems.

        We release training data, which consists of English open-QA data from

      <h3>Constrained Setup</h3>
      <p>
        To be considered as constrained setup submission, participants are
        required to use our official training corpus, which consists of examples
        pooled from the aforementioned datasets. No other question answering
        data may be used for training. We allow and encourage participants to
        use off-the-shelf tools for linguistic annotation (e.g. POS taggers,
        syntactic parsers), as well as any publicly available unlabeled data and
        models derived from these (e.g. word vectors, pre-trained language
        models).

        NB: In the constrained setup, participants may NOT use external blackbox 
        APIs such as Google Search API / Google Translate API for *inference*, 
        but they are permitted to use them for offline data augmentation or 
        training.
      </p>
      <h3>Unconstrained Setup</h3>
      <p>
        Although participants can use whatever data, all of the submissions of
        the models trained on additional human-annotated question answering data
        will be considered as “unconstrained” setup, and participants need to
        clarify it and provide the details of the additional resources used
        during the training. For example, you can use publicly available QA
        datasets (e.g., CMRC 2018, FQuAD) to create a larger scale of training
        data. Note that automatically augmenting the original training data
        using machine translations or additional resources (e.g., Wikidata
        information) will still be considered as “constrained” as mentioned
        above. Yet, we encourage participants who use additional training data
        or augment training data using those tools to release their training
        corpora. Again, even in the unconstrained setup, participants may not
        train on the development subsets of Natural Questions and TyDi QA.

        NB: In the unconstrained setup, participants may use external blackbox 
        APIs such as Google Search API / Google Translate API for inference 
        or training.
      </p>

    <div class="container">
      <h2>Development & Test Datasets</h2>
      <p>
        The evaluation data is originally from the XOR-TyDi QA dataset and MKQA
        data.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://nlp.cs.washington.edu/xorqa/" target="_blank"
            >XOR-TyDi QA</a
          >
          (Asai et al., 2021)
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/apple/ml-mkqa" target="_blank">MKQA</a
          >-answerable (Longpre et al., 2021) (<em
            >We only include the questions with answer annotations and remove
            the “no answers” questions</em
          >)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As the original MKQA dataset does not have a dev/test split, we will
        randomly split the data into dev (1758 questions) and test (5000)
        questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although we have multiple ground-truth answers from XOR-TyDi QA, for
        questions that have Wikipedia entities as answers, we use Wikipedia
        aliases as valid answers along with the given answer, following Trivia
        QA (Joshi et al., 2017) and MKQA.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Answer Retrieval Corpus</h2>
      <p>
        We will release preprocessed Wikipedia passages in the target 14
        languages. If you are participating in the constrained tack, you may not
        use any additional knowledge sources. If you are participating in the
        unconstrained track, you can use additional knowledge sources (e.g.,
        non-Wikipedia articles), but again you have to provide detailed
        descriptions of the knowledge sources. We also encourage you to release
        your own knowledge sources if possible.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Model Size</h2>
      <p>
        We do not have any restrictions on the model size or model type, but
        participants will be required to provide detailed information about
        their models and training procedures as well as the answer retrieval
        corpus.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Baseline Models</h2>
      <p>
        We will release easy-to-use baselines for cross-lingual open-retrieval
        QA in February, with trained models. Please stay tuned!
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
      <h2>Data Format and Submission Instructions</h2>
      <p>
        Submission instructions will be released in February 2022. We will
        detail data format and submission instructions, along with our baseline
        models, in our
