      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        State-of-the-art NLP technologies such as neural question answering or
        information retrieval systems have enabled many people to access
        information efficiently. However, these advances have been made in an
        English-first way, leaving other languages behind. Large-scale
        multilingual pre-trained models have achieved significant performance
        improvements on many multilingual NLP tasks where input text is
        provided. Yet, on knowledge-intensive tasks that require retrieving
        knowledge and generating output, we observe limited progress. Moreover,
        in many languages, existing knowledge sources are critically limited.
        This workshop addresses challenges for building information access
        systems in many languages. In particular, we attempt to discuss several
        core challenges in this field, e.g.:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Resource creations for low-resource languages</li>
        <li>
          Language disparity in modeling multiple languages in one single model
          or data curation process
        </li>
        <li>Lack of considerations for language speakers' use cases</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        We cover diverse topics of
        <strong>cross-lingual knowledge-intensive</strong> NLP tasks such as
        cross-lingual question answering, information retrieval, fact
        verification, and information extraction. By grouping those tasks into a
        cross-lingual information access topic, we encourage the communities to
        work together towards building a general framework that supports
        multilingual information access.

                  <b>Abstract:</b> Currently, multilingual information access
                  (MIA) particularly by Question Answering (QA) has a major
                  problem. Most QA research software sits in someone's own
                  Github repository and none of those softwares work easily with
                  each other. This problem is exacerbated in different
                  modalities of QA research: document retrieval, reading
                  comprehension, QA over tables, QA over images, videos etc.
                  We're introducting PrimeQA, a one-stop shop for all Open QA
                  problems. I'll talk about how PrimeQA is remediating the MIA
                  problem by bringing together all these QA software/ solutions
                  as building blocks and creating a one repository where a
                  user/student can come in and quickly replicate the
                  latest/greatest QA paper/publication thatâ€™s at the top of a
                  leaderboard (e.g. XOR TyDi) without re-inventing the wheel.

                  <b>Abstract:</b> Pre-trained multilingual models are strong
                  baselines for multilingual applications but they often lack
                  capacity and underperform when dealing with under-represented
                  languages. In this talk, I will discuss work on building
                  parameter-efficient models, which has recently received
                  increased attention. I will discuss how such methods can be
                  used to specialize models to specific languages, enabling
                  strong performance even on unseen languages. I will
                  demonstrate the benefits of this methodology such as increased
                  robustness (to different hyper-parameter choices as well as to
                  catastrophic forgetting) and efficiency (in terms of time,
                  space, and samples). Finally, I will highlight future
                  directions in this area.

                  <b>Abstract:</b> Subword and character-based language models
                  still cannot capture non-concatenative morphological
                  information due to character fusion in morphologically rich
                  languages. In this talk, I will present KinyaBERT, a simple
                  yet effective two-tier BERT architecture that uses the
                  combination of a morphological analyzer and BPE at the input
                  level to explicitly represent morphological compositionality.
                  A robust set of experimental results reveal that KinyaBERT
                  outperforms solid baselines by 2% in F1 score on a named
                  entity recognition task and by 4.3% in average score of a
                  machine-translated GLUE benchmark. KinyaBERT fine-tuning has
                  better convergence and achieves more robust results on
                  multiple tasks even in the presence of translation noise.

                  <b>Bio:</b> Graham Neubig is an associate professor at the
                  Language Technologies Institute of Carnegie Mellon University.
                  His research focuses on multilingual natural language
                  processing, natural language interfaces to computers, and
                  machine learning methods for NLP, with the final goal of every
                  person in the world being able to communicate with each-other,
                  and with computers in their own language. He also contributes
                  to making NLP research more accessible through open publishing
                  of research papers, advanced NLP course materials and video
                  lectures, and open-source software, all of which are available

                  building a benchmark to measure the progress of natural

                  <b>Abstract:</b> Multilingual sentence representations are very useful to
                  extend NLP applications to more languages. One particular
                  application is bitext mining based on a similarity measure in
                  such a multilingual representation space. Well known
                  approaches are LASER or LABSE, but both are limited to about
                  100 languages.

                <p>
                  In this talk, we report our work to extend multilingual
                  sentence representations to 200 languages. We discuss
                  challenges when handling low-resource languages, in particular
                  collection of resources to train and evaluate such models.
                  Those sentence encoders are used to mine more than one billion
                  sentences of bitexts in 148 languages. Finally, we report the
                  impact of the mined data when training a massively
                  multilingual NMT system.

                  <b>Abstract:</b> Korean and Indonesian are considerably different from English,
                  and both have recently gained attention from researchers
                  building datasets for a diverse set of languages. I will start
                  this talk by sharing our research on ethnic bias in BERT
                  language models in six different languages which illustrates
                  the importance of studying multiple languages. I will then
                  describe our efforts in building datasets for Korean and
                  Indonesian and the main challenge of dataset building when the
                  sources of data are much smaller compared to English and other
                  major languages. I will also share our research on historical
                  documents written in ancient Korean which is not understood
                  and must be translated into modern Korean.
